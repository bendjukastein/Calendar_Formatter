# Calendar_Formatter
Given an input text file, the program will print to the console a much more readable, chronologically ordered calendar within a specified date range, including all instances of repeating events.

I completed this project as part of SENG 265, a course offered at UVic. All code outside of the Calprint files themselves are entirety the creation of professor Mike Zastre.
